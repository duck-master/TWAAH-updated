The girl hated me but the boy was my friend and he came out to talk with me. Then he held a model helicopter above his head and started to fly, so I followed him. Then we sat on a ridge coming out of a building. He said he could fly like me now but not without the helicopter. All of a sudden the ridge we were on broke, and we fell. Then further down the street I saw a lady in a business suit coming towards us. I started to run, but she was able to catch me. I tried to get away by flying but she was holding onto me so tight I could hardly get off the ground. Then she took me to a store that reminded me of Korea. Then she said I could have anything I wanted but I refused. Then the people from the north came by and got me away from the lady and took me skiing in some odd apparel."Lauree and Anna-Diana had a nice conversation.

"It was like watching a cartoon show. There was this guy and he left home &amp; met a girl, but she didn't like him all that much. He was pretty stupid. Back home his little sis (about 5 years old) &amp; his parents are watching a movie. The parents were sitting on her to keep her quiet. All I saw was their butts and her head &amp; shoulders. She was squirming and when she finally got her head out she yelled something like \"(brother's name) got out of the house and is running around with a girl!\" Then back to the girl &amp; guy. They suddenly had a fat guy friend with them. They did some stuff, but all I remember is a scene with the guy on a pay phone in a hotel with the other two standing around. The girl got mad and walked away. The guy dropped the phone and followed. There was more but I don't remember it."

After the lady goes to one of the shops, my mom whispers to my grandma that she is a rapist. I heard that and was scared. So I look around at one jewelry shop when I have to go to the bathroom. The strange lady came by and I told her I had to go. She said, \"I'll take you,\" and grinned at me. I screamed for my grandma and when she came I said to both of them, \"Will you both take me?\" because I didn't want to be alone with the lady. My grandma told me she would be delighted to take me to the bathroom. The bathroom is all set up like a stable and I go in one of the stalls. Then my grandma said she had to leave and I was going to have to walk alone with this lady. When I get into the stall, it's not a stall. There's a rodeo going on. My friend Diana was there and I asked her if she could walk me back, but she couldn't.

"Lauree, what did you dream about last night?" asked Krissie. Lauree seemed wary, but her face softened.
"The Starship Voyager had a large delegation from a strange planet. Be'lanna Torres was working with the son of the leaders. She says she wants to show him something while they're in engineering. She beckons him behind a tree into a garden; he is confused. She takes two willow branches off a tree and I get the feeling she is about to start the Klingon mating ritual. The next thing I know I am in a bedroom. The son is in a bed with his grandma (I guess there wasn't enough room). Be'lanna was standing next to the bed. Also the whole alien delegation is in there and everyone is wearing ceremonial robes, even Be'lanna and the people in bed. Then either Be'lanna or the son said to each other they had a lot of fun last night. The leaders looked very disapproving and the guards started to spin their spears."

"Dreams," Krissie said. "Tell me about your dreams." Tildi almost said nothing, but thought better of it.
"I was going to fence someone but all of the swords didn't have long blades. I asked some buy to fence and he turned out to be my friend's brother. We were talking and he told me he was taking calculus XZ. Then he smiled at me and I think I liked him. He said two nice things to me and said something about the difference in our age. Then he said, \"You aren't using my sister to get to me?\" I said no and he said, \"I don't want my sister to get hurt.\" Before that, we were at camp and assigned to jobs before the feast. I went downstairs to this beach; someone was telling me about how people died in a volcano here. It reminded me of Mt. Vesuvius. Then me &amp; Jeanette went down a dark road in a car to go grocery shopping even though it wasn't my job. Then I went down stairs to the boys school where my old crush R. went to school. I was looking for him but I couldn't find him."

"There were these really cute guys outside of my house and they stopped at my neighbor's house to ask who I was, so I ran upstairs and told my sister. We went outside to talk to the guys but as we stood outside my mom drove up and crashed into the car in front of her."Georgeanne and Tildi had a nice conversation.
